## Portfolio
My Portfolio - created using ReactJS

I have created another portfolio using ReactJS. Which is also open source. Fork it from here: https://github.com/p32929/p32929.github.io

## Prerequisites
You need to have `NodeJS` and `NPM` installed in your computer.
If you don't have them installed, installed them from here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

## How to run the project
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your forked repository
3. Install all the dependencies using this command:
`npm install`
4. Run the project using this command:
`npm start`

## Create your own portfolio
1. To edit the Home section, edit the variables inside `src/vars/homeItems.js` file.
2. To edit the Skills section, edit the variables inside `src/vars/skillItems.js` file.
3. To edit the Projects section, edit the variables inside `src/vars/projectItems.js` file.
4. To edit the Contact section, edit the variables inside `src/vars/contactItems.js` file.
5. To edit the Drawer Items, edit the variables inside `src/vars/drawerItems.js` file.
6. Inside `package.json`, change the value of `homepage` to 'https://your-github-username.github.io/Portfolio/'
7. Run this command: `npm run deploy`
8. Go the the repository settings page > Github Pages > Source and set it to `gh-pages branch`
9. That's it. Now, you can check your portfolio LIVE version in github pages using `homepage` URL. Github may take a while to update the github page into your `homepage` URL

## Thanks
Hope you'll enjoy creating your own portfolio :)
